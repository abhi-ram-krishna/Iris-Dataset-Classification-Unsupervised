# Iris Dataset Classification
The "Iris" dataset, originally published at UCI Machine Learning Repository is often used for testing out machine learning algorithms and visualizations. Each row of the dataset represents an iris flower, including its species and dimensions of its botanical parts, sepal and petal, in centimeters.<br>
In this project we use KMeans clustering and Hierarchical clustering techniques to classify the data into clusters and determine optimal number of clusters along.
